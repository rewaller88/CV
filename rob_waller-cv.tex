\begin{itemize}

\item Project lead for a nuclear engineering safety case development program.  Responsible for interpreting experimental and calculated data to provide recommendations on safety case limitations for future operation.

\item Responsible for amalgamating the results of studies conducted by Rolls Royce and Wood group to make recommendations to the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator that plants are safe to operate, extending the operational life of 2 nuclear plants.

\item Acted as Assistant Duly Authorised Person (ADAP). 

\end{itemize}

\smallskip 
				
\subsubsection*{Electrical Officer \& Assistant Engineer \hfill 2016--2018}  
\normalfont
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sole British crew member on the USS Hartford, a Los-Angeles Class fast attack submarine on operations including surfacing at North Pole. 
	 
	\item 2000 hours experience as Qualified Critical plant supervisor and 50 days of experience as Shutdown plant supervisor. 6 successful reactor startups and shutdowns as plant supervisor.
	
\item  Responsible for \$1.5 billion submarine alongside, managing a 25-person team for 24-hour periods. 
\item Direct management responsibility for 15 nuclear electricians, coordinating the response to unplanned defects as well as supervising all electrical maintenance activities onboard. 

\item Passed professional examinations and interviews at Naval Reactors in Washington DC (PNEO), giving certification to operate as the Chief Engineer on a USN nuclear plant. 

\item Qualified as a Duly Authorised Person (DAP), providing oversight to complex nuclear operations such as cool downs, control rod testing, switchboard maintenance and live plant drill periods.
\end{itemize}

\smallskip 

\subsubsection*{Submarine Sustainable Manning Program \hfill 2015 - 2016}  
\normalfont
\begin{itemize}
	\item Facilitated a study with PA Consulting, analysing novel ways of staffing Nuclear control rooms with contractors during maintenance periods. 
	
	\item Conducted training needs analysis of a shut-down nuclear operator in order to enable contractorisation. Resulted in 2 contractors undertaking trial periods of nuclear operation on a submarine.\end{itemize}

\smallskip 
				
\subsubsection*{Naval Nuclear Power Training Command \hfill 2014--2015}  
\normalfont
\begin{itemize}
	\item Selected as top student of 18 candidates on graduate scheme to undertake a prestigious 3-year exchange with the US Navy. 
	
	\item Undertook 6-months of academically rigorous training before a further 6-month period of rotational shift work on a 'prototype' S5W reactor design at Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit Charleston. 
	\item Certified by the US Navy and the US Department of Energy to be a Nuclear Engineering Officer of the Watch, qualifying early, with above average marks in all assessments.
